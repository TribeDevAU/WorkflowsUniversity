# Views

Welcome to the training module on views. In this module, you'll learn about views and how to use them to access and manipulate data from the database. 

A view is a customised list of data from the database that is saved as a virtual table. You can use views to present data in a specific way, or to hide certain columns or rows from the original table. 

You'll learn how to create and manage views, and how to use them to access and query data from the database. 

By the end of this module, you'll have a solid understanding of views and be able to use them effectively in your work with databases. Let's get started.
